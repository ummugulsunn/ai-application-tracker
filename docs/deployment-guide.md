```

### 2. Vercel Configuration

The application includes a `vercel.json` configuration file with:
- Security headers
- Performance optimizations
- Function timeouts
- Caching rules

## Deployment Process

### Automated Deployment (Recommended)

The application includes GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployment:

1. **Push to `develop` branch** → Deploys to development environment
2. **Push to `main` branch** → Deploys to staging environment  
3. **Manual workflow dispatch** → Deploys to production environment

### Manual Deployment

Use the included deployment script:

```bash
# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# Deploy to production (requires confirmation)
npm run deploy:production

# Dry run (see what would be deployed)
./scripts/deploy.sh production --dry-run
```

### Deployment Script Features

The `scripts/deploy.sh` script includes:
- Prerequisites checking
- Automated testing
- Security scanning
- Build optimization
- Health checks
- Deployment reporting

## Monitoring Setup

### 1. Health Checks

The application includes comprehensive health monitoring:

- **Endpoint**: `/api/health`
- **Checks**: Database, storage, AI services, memory usage
- **Monitoring**: Automated alerts on failures

### 2. Performance Monitoring

Real-time performance tracking includes:
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS, TTFB)
- Resource loading times
- JavaScript errors
- User interactions

### 3. Error Tracking

Comprehensive error monitoring:
- Client-side JavaScript errors
- API errors and failures
- Performance issues
- User-reported issues

### 4. Analytics (Privacy-Focused)

Optional analytics system with:
- GDPR compliance
- Do Not Track respect
- Data anonymization
- Cookie consent management

## Feature Flags

The application uses a feature flag system for gradual rollouts:

### Available Flags
- `ai_insights` - AI-powered application analysis
- `advanced_csv_import` - Enhanced CSV import features
- `user_authentication` - Optional user accounts
- `backup_system` - Automated backup functionality
- `performance_monitoring` - Performance tracking
- `analytics_tracking` - User analytics
- `pwa_features` - Progressive Web App features

### Configuration

Feature flags can be configured via:
1. Environment variables (`FEATURE_FLAGS` JSON)
2. API endpoints (`/api/feature-flags`)
3. Admin dashboard (`/admin/monitoring`)

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

### Automated Backups

The system includes automated backup functionality:
- **Frequency**: Every 6 hours
- **Retention**: 30 backups
- **Storage**: Local storage + optional cloud storage
- **Types**: Full and incremental backups

### Manual Backup

```bash
# Create manual backup
npm run backup

# Via admin dashboard
# Navigate to /admin/monitoring and click "Create Backup"
```

### Disaster Recovery

The system can restore from any backup:
1. Access admin dashboard (`/admin/monitoring`)
2. View backup history
3. Select backup to restore
4. Confirm restoration process
