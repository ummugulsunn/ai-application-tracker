- Export functionality
- Responsive design with mobile support
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

#### `TrendsAnalysis`
Specialized component for trend analysis:
- Configurable timeframes and metrics
- Interactive trend indicators
- Comparative analysis visualization
- Seasonal pattern charts

### Data Processing

#### Analytics Calculations
- **Success Rates**: Interview rate = (interviews / total applications) × 100
- **Response Times**: Average days between application and response
- **Trend Detection**: Linear regression and comparative analysis
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Monthly and weekly aggregations
- **Benchmarking**: Industry average comparisons

#### Filtering Logic
- **Date Range**: Filter applications by applied date
- **Status Filter**: Include/exclude specific application statuses
