# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Remove hydration-causing conditional rendering in ApplicationTable
  - Remove the `isClient` state and related useEffect
  - Eliminate conditional rendering between server and client paths
  - Ensure single consistent rendering path for table structure
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Implement hydration-safe date formatting
  - Replace `formatDistanceToNow` with static date formatting for SSR
  - Create utility function for consistent date display across server/client
  - Add client-side relative time as progressive enhancement
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 3.3_

- [x] 3. Fix table row key generation for consistency
  - Ensure table row keys are deterministic and stable
  - Remove any dynamic or time-based elements from keys
  - Test key consistency across server and client renders
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.3_

- [x] 4. Refactor animation system to prevent hydration mismatches
  - Remove conditional DOM structure differences between animated/non-animated states
  - Implement animations as CSS-only enhancements that don't affect DOM structure
  - Add post-hydration animation enablement without changing markup
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 5. Create hydration-safe utility functions
  - Build date formatting utilities that work identically on server and client
  - Create progressive enhancement helpers for client-only features
  - Add validation functions to detect potential hydration issues
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1_

- [x] 6. Add error boundary for hydration error handling
  - Create error boundary component to catch hydration-related errors
  - Implement fallback UI for hydration failures
  - Add logging and monitoring for hydration issues
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 7. Write comprehensive tests for hydration consistency
  - Create tests to verify server and client render identical HTML
  - Add tests for date formatting consistency across environments
  - Test progressive enhancement functionality
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 4.4_

- [x] 8. Update related components to prevent future hydration issues
  - Review and fix any similar patterns in Dashboard component
  - Update other components that use time-sensitive formatting
  - Implement consistent SSR-safe patterns across the application
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2_
