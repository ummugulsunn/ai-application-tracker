# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses hydration errors occurring in the Next.js application, specifically in the ApplicationTable component. Hydration errors happen when server-rendered HTML doesn't match client-side rendering, causing React to regenerate the entire component tree on the client side, leading to poor performance and potential UI flickers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate hydration errors in the ApplicationTable component, so that the application renders consistently between server and client.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the ApplicationTable SHALL render without hydration mismatches
2. WHEN server-side rendering occurs THEN the HTML output SHALL match the client-side rendering exactly
3. WHEN the component mounts THEN there SHALL be no console errors related to hydration
4. WHEN data is displayed in the table THEN it SHALL appear consistently across server and client renders

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load smoothly without visual glitches, so that I have a seamless experience when viewing my job applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN there SHALL be no visible content shifts or flickers
2. WHEN the ApplicationTable renders THEN the data SHALL appear immediately without re-rendering
3. WHEN navigating to the dashboard THEN the loading experience SHALL be smooth and consistent
4. WHEN the table contains data THEN it SHALL display properly formatted content from the first render

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement proper SSR-safe patterns, so that future hydration issues are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using dynamic content THEN the component SHALL use proper SSR-safe techniques
2. WHEN handling client-only features THEN they SHALL be properly isolated from server rendering
3. WHEN using external data THEN it SHALL be properly synchronized between server and client
4. WHEN implementing date/time formatting THEN it SHALL be consistent across server and client environments

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and fix all potential sources of hydration mismatches, so that the application is robust and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing components THEN all potential hydration issues SHALL be identified
2. WHEN using browser-specific APIs THEN they SHALL be properly guarded for SSR compatibility
3. WHEN rendering dynamic content THEN it SHALL use deterministic rendering patterns
4. WHEN handling user-specific data THEN it SHALL be properly managed for SSR scenarios
