# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical TypeScript errors in the backup system that are preventing proper compilation and testing. The errors primarily involve type mismatches between Date objects and string representations, undefined object access, and React component type issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backup system to have consistent date handling, so that TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backup service processes application data THEN all date fields SHALL be consistently typed as strings
2. WHEN test files create mock application data THEN date fields SHALL match the Application type definition
3. WHEN backup service serializes dates THEN it SHALL convert Date objects to ISO string format
4. WHEN backup service deserializes dates THEN it SHALL handle both string and Date inputs gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want backup tests to handle potentially undefined objects safely, so that tests run without runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests access application properties THEN they SHALL check for undefined values before property access
2. WHEN backup service returns application data THEN tests SHALL handle cases where applications might be undefined
3. WHEN comparing application data THEN tests SHALL use safe property access patterns
4. WHEN filtering application arrays THEN tests SHALL handle undefined elements properly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want React components in the backup system to have proper TypeScript types, so that JSX compilation succeeds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN BackupManager renders child elements THEN all children SHALL be properly typed as ReactNode
2. WHEN backup components use unknown types THEN they SHALL be cast to appropriate React types
3. WHEN backup UI displays dynamic content THEN type assertions SHALL be used safely
4. WHEN backup components handle user interactions THEN event types SHALL be properly defined
